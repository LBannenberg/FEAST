# FEAST
Function Evolution using Abstract Syntax Trees

## Introduction
This code is part of my computer science masters thesis project. The main goal is to be able to compare Grammatica Evolution against alternatives. We start out with some baseline evolutionary algorithms, and then see if we can improve some of their aspects using a hyperoptimization heuristic, such as:
* Just the baseline algorithm with no further optimization, as benchmark
* Grammatical Evolution (GE)
* Genetic Programming (GP)
* Random Search using a greedy hill climber (GHC)
